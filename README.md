# Keeping our DigiTech Resources on GitHub
For this semester we will try out using GitHub for a whole bunch of our resources, 
including code samples, documents and anything else I feel like dishing out. 
You can access this at https://github.com/mrmatho,  by synching up your GIT client in VS Code or
by using any other Git client if you get really excited about it.
